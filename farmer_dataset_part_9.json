If absolutely necessary, chemical measure: rotate pesticide classes to reduce resistance build-up (use responsibly).\n\nUse community action for outbreak-level issues (coordinated spraying or sanitation).\n\nIf symptoms are mild on garlic, act quickly with organic measures and regular monitoring.\n\nHow to apply treatments safely: always wear protective gear (gloves, mask) while preparing and spraying. Measure quantities accurately and avoid mixing incompatible chemicals. Field trials on small plots can reveal which local seed or technique works best for garlic.",
