    "answer": "This practical guidance focuses on mango. Below are likely causes, step-by-step actions, prevention, and farmer-friendly tips you can try immediately.\n\nLikely causes include: early pest infestation reducing vigor; inadequate or irregular irrigation; nutrient lockout due to combined application mistakes.\n\nCase example: A cooperative reduced post-harvest losses by adopting simple solar dryers for small fruits..\n\nStep-by-step action plan:\n1. Maintain basic hygiene and timely field inspections.\n2. Remove and isolate badly affected plants to prevent spread; do not compost visibly infected tissue.\n3. Increase potassium and phosphorus at fruiting stage if fruit development is weak (after soil test).\n4. Reduce nitrogen application if excessive leaf growth is delaying flowering/fruiting.\n5. Increase potassium and phosphorus at fruiting stage if fruit development is weak (after soil test).\n6. Maintain basic hygiene and timely field inspections.\n\nRecommended organic practice: introduce parasitoids and predatory insects (ladybirds, lacewings). If absolutely necessary, chemical measure: apply systemic insecticide during pest's most vulnerable stage (follow safety rules) (use responsibly).\n\nPrevention & long-term practices: perform soil testing and apply balanced fertilizers; ensure correct plant spacing for good air circulation; maintain field sanitation and remove diseased residues.\n\nFarmer tips: engage local extension services for confirmatory lab tests | participate in farmer groups to buy inputs in bulk and get better rates.\n\nIf problems persist, contact local agri-extension for sample testing and targeted advice.\n\nFor medium severity issues on mango, combine immediate action with soil testing and moderate chemical inputs if needed.\n\nHow to apply treatments safely: always wear protective gear (gloves, mask) while preparing and spraying. Measure quantities accurately and avoid mixing incompatible chemicals. mango often benefits from a late-season potassium top-up for better fruit quality.",

Below are likely causes, step-by-step actions, prevention, and farmer-friendly tips you can try immediately.\n\nCase example: Switching to a certified, disease-resistant variety reduced fungicide usage significantly in one village..\n\nPrevention & long-term practices: keep records of sprays, rainfall, and yields for future decisions; maintain field sanitation and remove diseased residues; perform soil testing and apply balanced fertilizers.\n\nLikely causes include: delayed planting leading to mismatch with season; improper seed or variety choice for local climate; soil pH imbalance affecting nutrient availability.\n\nRecommended organic practice: apply neem oil spray every 10–14 days as preventive measure. If absolutely necessary, chemical measure: follow pre-harvest intervals strictly to meet market safety standards (use responsibly).\n\nFarmer tips: market early with good packing to avoid price fall | participate in farmer groups to buy inputs in bulk and get better rates.\n\nStep-by-step action plan:\n1. Mulch around the base of the plants to conserve moisture and suppress weeds.\n2. Reduce nitrogen application if excessive leaf growth is delaying flowering/fruiting.\n3. Remove and isolate badly affected plants to prevent spread; do not compost visibly infected tissue.\n4. Monitor weekly with a simple checklist: pest counts, leaf color, flower set, and soil moisture.\n5. Reduce nitrogen application if excessive leaf growth is delaying flowering/fruiting.\n6. Monitor weekly with a simple checklist: pest counts, leaf color, flower set, and soil moisture.\n\nUse community action for outbreak-level issues (coordinated spraying or sanitation).\n\nIf symptoms are mild on sugarcane, act quickly with organic measures and regular monitoring.\n\nHow to apply treatments safely: always wear protective gear (gloves, mask) while preparing and spraying.

Below are likely causes, step-by-step actions, prevention, and farmer-friendly tips you can try immediately.\n\nPrevention & long-term practices: ensure correct plant spacing for good air circulation; keep records of sprays, rainfall, and yields for future decisions; install proper drainage and raised beds in waterlogged fields.\n\nCase example: A trial plot using biofertilizers showed improved plant vigor over two seasons..\n\nStep-by-step action plan:\n1. Monitor weekly with a simple checklist: pest counts, leaf color, flower set, and soil moisture.\n2. Maintain basic hygiene and timely field inspections.\n3. Maintain basic hygiene and timely field inspections.\n4. Test soil and leaf tissue when symptoms are unclear—this reduces guesswork and saves money.\n5. Remove and isolate badly affected plants to prevent spread; do not compost visibly infected tissue.\n6. Reduce nitrogen application if excessive leaf growth is delaying flowering/fruiting.\n\nFarmer tips: try small-scale trials before full adoption of any new technique | store produce in ventilated crates away from direct sun | participate in farmer groups to buy inputs in bulk and get better rates | use shade nets during heat waves for sensitive vegetables.\n\nRecommended organic practice: mulch with straw or leaves to keep soil moisture stable. If absolutely necessary, chemical measure: rotate pesticide classes to reduce resistance build-up (use responsibly).\n\nLikely causes include: improper seed or variety choice for local climate; nutrient lockout due to combined application mistakes; viral infection causing mosaic patterns.\n\nUse community action for outbreak-level issues (coordinated spraying or sanitation).\n\nIf symptoms are mild on finger millet, act quickly with organic measures and regular monitoring.",
